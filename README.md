# 🍔 DineBites

**DineBites** is a web platform that allows students to order food and snacks directly from their **college canteen**.  
Instead of standing in queues, students can place orders online, track status, and pick them up when ready.  
Inspired by platforms like **Zomato**, but focused entirely on **college canteens in Tamil Nadu**.
